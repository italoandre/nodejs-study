# Studying NodeJS

Here you'll find some files I created in order to learn NodeJS and study some of its features. The files here are not complete projects, but just the product of some study and practice sessions.

## features used
- process.stdout.write
- process.stdin.on
- process.on
- prompt-sync
- setTimeOut
- clearTimeOut
- setInterval
- clearInterval

*Some features might appear only on history*
