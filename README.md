# Studying NodeJS

Here you'll find some files I created in order to learn NodeJS and study some of its features. The files here are not complete projects, but just the product of some study and practice sessions.

## bestme.js

This is from a class I saw on RocketSeat. This script asks you some questions about your day and by the end you do a little reflection upon your answers. This allowed me to test:
- process.stdout.write
- process.stdin.on
- process.on

*These are now only available on the history of the repository.*

The original script (from RocketSeat) had no support to multiple languages, so I dediced to add this feature. For it to work, I started working with:
- prompt-sync
